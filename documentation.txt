API:
*Not quite sure what needs to be documented here, but here we go*
We have functions for communicating between the database and client. They range from accessing a mySQL database to queries about getting rows from tables/updating another table with rows to doing specific things during specific actions like clicking a button for adding or removing a speicfic item from the transaction list. .  


/buttons queries the database and gets all the buttons in the till_buttons table, returning it to the client as json

/transaction queries the database to get all of the items in the transaction table, and returns it to the client as json

/list queries the database to get all of the items in the transaction table, and returns it to the client as json

/click takes in one parameter through use of ?id=... and uses it to query the database to get the price of an item based off the id, adds that item to a transaction table, refreshes the transaction table, and returns the current transaction table to the client as json

/remove takes in one parameter through use of ?id=... and uses to to query the database to delete entries from the transaction table

/login takes in two parameters through the use of ?uname=... and &pname=... and uses them to 'log in' to the server, which will display the till buttons on success. Returns true or false on success or fail.

/voidOrder takes no parameters and instructs the database to truncate the current transaction table. Returns 'voided' on success.

/sale takes in two parameters through the use of ?user=... and &total=... and uses them to complete missing details regarding to completing a transaction, and archiving it. Once it has done that it will return json with a 'receipt' for the purchase
